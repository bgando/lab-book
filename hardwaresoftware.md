# Hardware/Software

###Hardware
The ideal environment is a classroom with tables, chairs, presentation equipment, and at least 1 computer (Mac or PC) per 2 students.

###Software
Each computer in the classroom should have a text editor, git, and web browser installed that allows students to perform searches and make use of a variety of websites and Internet tools. Teachers will need to download and install the Scratch programming language available at http://www.scratch.mit.edu.
