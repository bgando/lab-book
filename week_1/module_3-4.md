# Module 3

###Topic Description
This lesson introduces the Scratch programming language, including the basic terms utilized in the language.

###Objectives:
The students will be able to:
- Name the basic terms used in Scratch.
- Create the beginning of a simple program in Scratch.

###Outline of the Lesson
- Journal Entry (5 minutes)
- KWL chart about programming/Scratch (15 minutes)
- Scratch introductory video (10 minutes)
- Model of how to start name assignment (25 minutes)

###Student Activities
- Complete journal entry.
- Complete KWL chart about programming/Scratch.
- Groups take turns sharing out their K’s and W’s orally.
- Watch Scratch introductory video.
- Follow along with Scratch open as teacher models how to start name assignment.

###Teaching/Learning Strategies
- Journal Entry: How do you think programs like Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer and Windows are made?
    - Discuss what it means to program a computer. Remind students that in the previous unit they used a markup language to provide instructions to the computer on the layout and content of web pages. Programming languages are used to translate algorithms into a language that a computer can execute.
- KWL chart
    - Students meet with groups and each group completes a KWL chart. (Know, Want to Learn,
Learned)
    - Groups take turns sharing out their K’s and W’s orally. Encourage them not to repeat anything
that has already been said.
    - Put KWL charts up in the classroom; tell students that they will finish the L towards the end of
the unit.
- Scratch introductory video
    - Played with sound. Can be played over a projector.
- Model of how to start name assignment
    - Address how sound will be handled in the classroom.
        - Scratch lends itself to playing sounds so it can get noisy. The teacher needs to decide how to address this. Headsets with microphones are one solution.
    - Build a name project similar to name.sb.
    - Emphasize
        - Every character in Scratch is called a Sprite.
        - Although Scratch is programming, it is not used in industry. Point out a few languages
that are used in industry—Java, C, C++. Throughout the unit, you will want to reinforce
that the basic constructs used in Scratch are also used in “industrial strength” languages.
        - How to choose a Sprite from a file
        - How to paint your own sprite
        - Each sprite has its own scripts.
        - You can right click any block and select help to get more information on how to use it.
        - How to change the language in Scratch (for your English Learners)
        - How to go to full screen mode and back
        - How to switch back and forth between sprites by clicking on them
        - X and Y coordinates on the screen are shown on the bottom right below the stage
        - How to save in the proper location (the default is to save in the Scratch Projects folder
(C:\\Program Files\Scratch\Projects))
        - The following blocks should be modeled:
            - Move _ steps
            - If on edge, bounce
            - Turn _ degrees
            - Forever
            - Change color effect by _
            - When the green flag is clicked
    - Encourage students to experiment. They can’t break the computer by dragging the wrong block.
    - Show students where they can access ScratchGettingStarted.pdf. (It would probably be useful to have printed copies for each student.)
    - Show students Name Sample Rubric.

###Materials
#####Sample Project Requirements
Do you have?
1. Have a separate sprite for each letter of your name.
2. Have at least 3 different interesting behaviors for the letters in your name.
3. ￼All the letters have a behavior
4. Use the “when green flag clicked” block
5. Use the “forever” block
6. (XC) Have your name reinitialize itself when the green flag is clicked. In other words, all the letters will start off in the right location facing the correct way.
